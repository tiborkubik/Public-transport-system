This application provides information about all lines and vehicles of a city transport system. 

User can speed up the simulation, move in time, pause, highlight specific lines and see information about vehicle's times of departures at all stops.

Administrator might add new lines, stops and also edit timetables as all these information are in XML files. 
This means you can simulate any city.

Admin can add detours in case of an accident or road closure. All cars that usually pass that route are then detoured.

Admin can specify the density of traffic on specific roads which affect delay of proper cars.
